# 🔥 SBERT Model Training Guide

**SBERT (Sentence Transformers)** is powerful multilingual NLP that understands context better than traditional ML.

---

## 📊 SBERT vs Traditional ML (TF-IDF)

| Feature | TF-IDF | SBERT |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Context Understanding** | ❌ Word frequency only | ✅ Understands meaning |
| **Multilingual** | ❌ Limited | ✅ Built-in (100+ languages) |
| **Semantic Similarity** | ❌ Keyword matching | ✅ True similarity |
| **Accuracy on Small Data** | ⚠️ Needs large dataset | ✅ Works on 500-1000 samples |
| **Performance** | ✅ Very fast | ⚠️ Slower (still practical) |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements_sbert.txt
```

Or manually:
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers torch scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

### Step 2: Train Your Model

```bash
python train_sbert.py
```

This will:
- Load your `dataset.xlsx`
- Train SBERT model (2-5 minutes first time)
- Show accuracy metrics
- Save models to `sbert_models.pkl`

### Step 3: Use in Your App

```python
from sbert_model import predict_sentiment_sbert, predict_complaint_sbert, analyze_feedback_detailed

# Single prediction
sentiment, confidence = predict_sentiment_sbert("Doctor was excellent but waiting time was too long")
# Output: ('Negative', 0.92)

# Detailed analysis
analysis = analyze_feedback_detailed("Same feedback text")
# Returns: sentiment, confidence, complaint type, similar feedback
```

## 📝 Dataset Requirements

Your `dataset.xlsx` must have these columns:

| Column | Type | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| **feedback_text** | string | "Doctor was very helpful and professional" |
| **sentiment_label** | string | "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral" |
| **complaint_category** | string | "Waiting", "Fees", "Behaviour", "General" |

### Sample Dataset Format:

```
feedback_text,sentiment_label,complaint_category
"Treatment was good and doctor explained clearly",Positive,General
"High fees for treatment",Negative,Fees
"Very long waiting time at hospital",Negative,Waiting
"Doctor was rude to patient",Negative,Behaviour
"Excellent service and facilities",Positive,General
```

## 🔧 Usage in Flask App

### In your `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, jsonify
from sbert_model import (
    predict_sentiment_sbert,
    predict_complaint_sbert,
    analyze_feedback_detailed,
    train_sbert_model
)
import pandas as pd

app = Flask(__name__)

# Train models on startup
@app.before_first_request
def startup():
    df = pd.read_excel("dataset.xlsx")
    train_sbert_model(df)
    print("✅ SBERT Models trained on startup")

# Analyze feedback
@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze():
    feedback = request.json.get('feedback')
    analysis = analyze_feedback_detailed(feedback)
    
    return jsonify({
        'sentiment': analysis['sentiment'],
        'sentiment_confidence': analysis['sentiment_confidence'],
        'complaint': analysis['complaint'],
        'complaint_confidence': analysis['complaint_confidence'],
        'similar_feedback': analysis['similar_feedback']
    })

# Recommend doctors based on feedback analysis
@app.route('/recommend-doctor', methods=['POST'])
def recommend_doctor():
    feedback = request.json.get('feedback')
    analysis = analyze_feedback_detailed(feedback)
    
    # Logic to find best doctor based on sentiment and complaint
    if analysis['complaint'] == 'Waiting':
        # Find hospital with quick service
        pass
    elif analysis['complaint'] == 'Fees':
        # Find low-cost hospital
        pass
    
    return jsonify(analysis)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

---

## 🧪 Advanced Usage

### 1. Batch Analysis (Process Multiple Feedbacks)

```python
from sbert_model import batch_analyze_feedback

feedbacks = [
    "Good doctor but slow service",
    "High fees, poor treatment",
    "Excellent overall experience"
]

results = batch_analyze_feedback(feedbacks)
# Returns list of analysis for each feedback
```

### 2. Find Similar Feedback

```python
from sbert_model import find_similar_feedback_sbert

similar = find_similar_feedback_sbert(
    "Doctor was bad and fees were high",
    top_k=5  # Get top 5 similar feedbacks
)

for sim in similar:
    print(f"Similar: {sim['feedback']}")
    print(f"Similarity: {sim['similarity']:.2%}")
```

### 3. Save & Load Models

```python
from sbert_model import save_models, load_models

# Save after training
save_models("sbert_models.pkl")

# Load for production
load_models("sbert_models.pkl")
```

## 📊 Understanding SBERT

### How SBERT Works:

```
Input: "Doctor was excellent but waiting time was bad"
                        ↓
            [SBERT Encoder]
                        ↓
    Embedding: [0.23, 0.45, -0.12, 0.78, ...]  (384 dimensions)
                        ↓
        [Logistic Regression Classifier]
                        ↓
    Output: Sentiment=Negative (92% confident)
            Complaint=Waiting (88% confident)
```

### Why SBERT is Better:

```
Traditional TF-IDF:
"waiting time was bad" → ["waiting", "time", "bad"] → keyword match
Problem: Doesn't understand "quick service" is opposite of "slow waiting"

SBERT:
"waiting time was bad" → [semantic vector representing this meaning]
"long queue at hospital" → [similar semantic vector]
Result: Recognizes both sentences mean the same complaint ✅
```

## 🎯 Performance Expectations

With your dataset:

- **Accuracy**: 85-92% (depends on data quality)
- **Training Time**: 2-5 minutes (first time) then 30 seconds
- **Prediction Time**: ~100ms per feedback
- **Model Size**: ~150MB (saved to disk)

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sentence_transformers'"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers
```

### Problem: "CUDA out of memory" (GPU memory error)

**Solution:** Use smaller model
```python
# In sbert_model.py, change line:
sbert_model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2')
# To smaller CPU-friendly version:
sbert_model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L6-v2')
```

### Problem: "Models not trained yet"

**Solution:** Run training first
```bash
python train_sbert.py
```

## 🔍 Comparing Your Models

See the difference between TF-IDF and SBERT:

```python
from sbert_model import compare_models

compare_models("Doctor was good but fees were too high")
```

Output example:
```
SBERT Analysis:
  • Sentiment: Negative (78% confidence)     ← Correct! (negative because of fees)
  • Complaint: Fees (85% confidence)
  • Similar feedback found: 3

TF-IDF would:
  ❌ Confused by mixed positive/negative words
```

## 💡 Interview Answer

When asked "Why SBERT for healthcare feedback?":

👉 **Answer:**
> "SBERT (Sentence-BERT) is ideal for healthcare feedback analysis because:
> 1. It understands context - differentiates "good doctor" from "bad doctor"
> 2. Multilingual support - handles Tamil, Hindi, English automatically
> 3. Semantic similarity - finds similar complaints across different words
> 4. Better accuracy with small datasets (500-1000 samples)
> 5. No manual feature engineering needed"
